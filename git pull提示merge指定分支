You asked me to pull without telling me which branch you
want to merge with, and 'branch.master.merge' in
your configuration file does not tell me, either. Please
specify which branch you want to use on the command line and
try again (e.g. 'git pull <repository> <refspec>').
See git-pull(1) for details.
If you often merge with the same branch, you may want to
use something like the following in your configuration file:
    [branch "master"]
    remote = <nickname>
    merge = <remote-ref>
    [remote "<nickname>"]
    url = <url>
    fetch = <refspec>
See git-config(1) for details.

需要建立和远端的分支对应关系:
解决办法: git br master --set-upstream origin/master
